Thus far,<br>he has been careful to steer around NATO and come<br>up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least<br>placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his<br>policy, but really the only logical one in terms of<br>Putin’s logical madness. NATO saw this coming, and the U.S.<br>saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that<br>expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any<br>unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO<br>also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the<br>pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much<br>like the fall of the USSR. In the event of<br>this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in<br>Russia awaits. When toppling the regime of a nuclear state,<br>outright war is off the table, but economic war is<br>a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the<br>assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over<br>the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale,<br>and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not<br>historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society<br>is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as<br>history shows. The issue remained, however, that the EU, and<br>NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war<br>on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade<br>a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO,<br>and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s<br>ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined<br>with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to<br>his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future<br>plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The<br>more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When<br>Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their<br>economy would in fact be at the total mercy of<br>the EU. As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with<br>their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of<br>the world watched in real time. Western media made sure<br>that the public knew exactly what was happening up to<br>the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K. and<br>U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally<br>broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much<br>attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised<br>sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents<br>and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped<br>his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to<br>“contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and<br>solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin<br>was now in a position where he must either invade<br>and face a united Western world that viewed him as<br>a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to<br>interfere, or else back off and loose face with the<br>public at home. His egotism won. With Russian war on<br>Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching<br>to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to<br>economic ruin.

           "**How much impact could Putin and Russia have over Donald<br>Trump?** Trump has long admired Russia and has not hidden<br>his admiration of Vladimir Putin. Two of his 3 wives<br>he has married are both native born, Russian speaking and<br>raised in Russian. Donald Trump the businessman has pursued business<br>deals in Russia since the early 1980’s and has traveled<br>there to explore potential business deals. After serious failures for<br>Trump in the 1990’s Trump suddenly reemerged back on the<br>scene. Trumps properties were flush with money from Russian leases.<br>Trump Tower had whole floors devoted to Russian tenants and<br>the building reached a level of 43% Russian leases. In<br>2008 at the height of the real estate housing bubble<br>burst and when the majority of real estate companies were<br>seeing revenues plummeting Trump was awash in cash. Donald Jr.<br>in a 2008 interview, said at a New York conference,<br>\"In terms of high-end, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate<br>cross-section of a lot of our assets,\" he went on<br>to say, “We see a lot of money pouring in<br>from Russia”. You would have to say that is a<br>fair number of Russian connections to this point. Let’s focus<br>a bit and look at just 6 month’s worth of<br>time in Trumps life. A very “short” snippet of time<br>that is available for all to look at or research.<br>A small slice of history, but in that slice is<br>revealed extensive correspondence, personal contact, organized meetings with Trump, The<br>Trump campaign, Trump staff, Trump advisors, Trump companions and the<br>Trump family with Russia’s highest levels. During the timeframe of<br>May 2016 thru to November 2016 Trump and his associates<br>had over 140 direct connections to Russian intelligence & government<br>officials. These contacts went unreported even though, such contacts are<br>required by several laws. Contacts that purposely attempted to hide<br>the contact and the conversations that transpired. Some contacts though<br>weren’t even a little subtle. Everyone should be able to<br>remember when, Trump while looking directly into a camera Infamously<br>and openly asked Putin for a favor when he notoriously<br>said, “Russia if your listening”. Trump Sr., explicitly pleaded Russia<br>to hack Clinton’s emails. That should give us an idea<br>of how comfortable Donald Trump was with Russia and bring<br>into question how much contact with Russia he actually had.<br>After that, Donnie Jr. held meetings with Russians where he<br>was directly seeking information from them that could be used<br>against Clinton, even though they were Russian operatives who were<br>working on behalf of the Kremlin. It is established that<br>the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. They hacked into<br>DNC party servers and finding emails that were actually written<br>by Democratic individuals and members of the Clinton campaign. They<br>then released those emails on website (Wikileaks) run Julian Assange<br>just after the meeting with Donald Jr., at a critical<br>time in the campaign to adversely affect Clinton and to<br>bolster Trump. Prior to any American campaigning, Assange was indicted<br>in America on 17 charges relating to the Espionage Act<br>in the United States District Court. Under the Espionage Act<br>charges Assange was facing a sentence of 170 years in<br>prison. Assange was indited for his role in the publication<br>of secret American documents on his website Wikileaks. Republican leaders<br>and the conservative media figures had been demanding prison time<br>(or worse) for Julian Assange for years. Suddenly, with Trump’s<br>requests and the release of information that negatively impacted his<br>Democratic opponent they were abruptly praising the Australian “anarchist”. From<br>that request for Russian help, it has been established that<br>LOTS of people in Trump’s circle had repeated contacts with<br>Russians. These contacts lead to an investigation that resulted in<br>dozens of criminal inditements. Inditements that had five of six<br>of Trump closest advisers pleading guilty. The list of Trump<br>associates who had contacts during just the six months in<br>question is staggering and formidable. Below is a short list<br>(but not all) of some of those who were close<br>to Trump, who held key positions, some of who were<br>indited and some who lied about contacts with Russians. •<br>Steve Bannon former campaign chief (Trump Pardoned) • Paul Manafort<br>Trump campaign chairman (Trump Pardoned) • Rick Gates Deputy Trump<br>campaign manager • Rudy Giuliani Trumps personal advisor • Michael<br>Flynn Trump's National Security Adviser (Trump Pardoned) • Jeff Sessions,<br>Trumps first Attorney General, • Donald Trump Jr. • Sam<br>Patten Republican donor operative • Roger Stone campaign advisor (Trump<br>Pardoned) • Tom Barrack, the chairman of Trump's Inaugural Committee<br>• Alex van der Zwaan a lawyer with Manafort (the<br>son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan George) • George Papadopoulos<br>Trumps foreign policy adviser, Michael Cohen Trumps personal attorney. Trump<br>ran as the most pro-Russian candidate for president, He candidly<br>admired Vladimir Putin’s manly virtues at every opportunity. Putin is<br>a career KGB officer, who unambiguously hates America and has<br>pursued the dismantling of NATO his entire career. Trumps visibly<br>friendly relationship with Putin despite the numerous issues that came<br>to light during Trumps Presidential term has had negative effects<br>on the American psyche.

Edit: I<br>strongly believe this is a brave act and I think<br>the pilot(s) must have been in contact with NATO and<br>the Romanian Air Force. There is no doubt in anyone's<br>mind here that Ukrainians are brave, saying anything otherwise is<br>silly. They likely landed due to lack of options as<br>the Ukrainian airports are under fire.

           "Just some ideas that might be helpful, this is not<br>professional advice: Make some bug out bags now. use backpacks.<br>Each person gets one bag. You need at ;least a<br>few bottles of water, some food (the longer lasting the<br>better) some lighters (two per bag) , a torch and<br>batteries. Don't use the torch unless you absolutely have to.<br>And at least one knife. And a can opener if<br>you take cans. Each bag should have each of these.<br>That way if you get separated you will be ok.<br>Humans can survive a long time without food; we die<br>after three days without water. Take a portable radio and<br>batteries too if you can so you can listen to<br>news even if you are not at home. Don't take<br>any glass bottles, they are heavy and can smash. Take<br>plastic. Buy some candles. If you already have candles, dig<br>them out now. Don;t wait until the lights go out<br>to try to find them. Put them somewhere obvious in<br>the living room and make sure there is a lighter<br>or matches with them. Take menstrual pads if you have<br>them; they can also be used as bandages..also take any<br>medicine anyone needs. Pack it now. Don't leave this till<br>last moment. The medicine goes in the pack of the<br>person who needs it. Might be good to label your<br>packs, or at least make sure everyone knows which pack<br>is theirs. Clean your bathtub now and fill it with<br>water. If the pumping station is attacked / turned off<br>you will not be able to get water from the<br>taps. Get some bandaids too and bandages if you have<br>them. And a pair of scissors. Take a full salt<br>container if you have it. A bottle of water with<br>salt in it is a saline solution and can be<br>used to clean wounds. 4 cups of water to two<br>teaspoons of salt. Make at least one now. Put important<br>papers for each of you inside a resealable plastic bag<br>and put it in your bugout bag. This includes birth<br>cert, ID, Passport, house ownership documents, bank book etc. Put<br>in a blanket each if you have room, and a<br>warm jacket. (thinner is better, you won;t have much room)<br>If you have children, put on small favorite toy in<br>their bag (children get a bag too.) This will help<br>them stay calm and quiet. Even just holding it can<br>help. Take a few packs of cigarettes each if you<br>have them. May be useful for bribes. Bottles of alcohol<br>can also be useful but are heavy. Your bug-out bag<br>should be a backpack for easy carrying and traveling. Get<br>some psychical cash NOW. ATM networks can go down, and<br>your plastic cards will be useless. Also people may stop<br>accepting them. Make sure you each have a decent amount<br>of cash. Put some in your bag, hide the rest<br>on your person in case you are searched. Get dressed,<br>including shoes.Make sure your house keys are already in your<br>pocket. If something happens, grab your bag and GO. Practice<br>doing this, say 1-2-3 go and then everyone must get<br>out the door ASAP. Do this until everyone can do<br>it quickly. Do not take pets with you. Leave them<br>behind. Mobile phones can be tracked, and the Russians probably<br>have some sort of scanner that can detect people hiding<br>by their mobile phones. Turning off the phone will not<br>prevent this. Double or triple wrap your mobile phones in<br>aluminium foil. Then try calling one. If it fails to<br>connect you might be ok. Keep in mind nobody will<br>be able to call you unless you unwrap it. Turn<br>off any scheduled alarms or calendar events or anything else<br>on your phone that may make a noise. If you're<br>hiding somewhere it could get you found and killed. Completely<br>charge all your mobile phones now. Leave them plugged in<br>and charging. When it's go time grab your phones and<br>chargers and put them in the bag, then go. Don't<br>forget to wrap them in layers of foil. You may<br>not be able to access power for a long time.<br>If you can, get a compass and a map. Don't<br>wear camo - you might get mistaken for a soldier.<br>Instead wear unobtrusive clothes. Sneakers may be better than boots<br>as you can move more quietly. It's also easier to<br>travel large distances. However boots may be longer wearing, especially<br>if they are leather. Everyone should be wearing the pair<br>they will need NOW. Or least put them near the<br>door, one pair in front of each person;s bag. A<br>plastic sheet as long as a human body would be<br>good, you can sleep on it even if the ground<br>i wet and wit will provide some warmth- even if<br>it is wet. Two might be good, one for the<br>top as well. Needs to be good strong plastic. You<br>can use your bag as a pillow. Be wary of<br>people you don;t know, even if they appear to be<br>other Ukrainians. They may be desperate and try to rob<br>you. Leave your TV and radio on and listen to<br>the news, 24 hours a day. If the authorities advise<br>getting out, get out. Don;t all sleep at the same<br>time, leave at least one person listening to tv or<br>radio at a time. Also they should keep an eye<br>out the windows. Sometimes news does not travel fast enough.<br>Stay together at home as much as you can from<br>now on. Don't anyone go to visit a neighbour five<br>miles away, unless you are happy to wait for them<br>when the time comes to suddenly leave. You may be<br>forced to leave within minutes; there will be no time<br>to wait for someone to come home. Don't leave everything<br>until you think it is time to go, it will<br>be too late and you will forget things. Start preparing<br>now.<br>"

We<br>have family and friends living in Kharkiv, and we are<br>all scared. What Putin and his goons did is unforgivable<br>and should not be tolerated, however you will not see<br>any protests and riots for peace in Russia. Everyone hates<br>Putin and the regime, no one dares to speak out,<br>and those who did are in prison right now, or<br>they magically disappeared, or died of unknown circumstances. The pigs<br>in the government fucked all of us over, the Russians,<br>the Ukrainians, and everyone else. In just one week, Putin<br>has turned the whole world against us. NATO, EU and<br>everyone else is hurling sanctions at us, the Russian people,<br>although not in immediate danger like the Ukrainians are, for<br>the lack of a better word, fucked. Soldiers will lose<br>their lives, and civilians will lose their homes. Many already<br>did. Right now, the lives of the Russian civilians depend<br>on the mercy of the West, including mine. No matter<br>what economic powerhouse Russia may be, no country's economy can<br>survive such devastating attacks. We are losing our income minute<br>by minute, and so are all of our friends who<br>moved abroad to get away from Putin's oppressive regime. The<br>EU is currently debating whether to cut Russia off from<br>SWIFT, and if they deem it necessary, all of our<br>lives are over. The Pig calling itself \"Putin\" deserves death<br>for what he did to his own nation and it's<br>people. Because of his actions, the world hates us. We<br>wanted nothing more than to live long and peaceful lives,<br>but he can't even give us that much. I do<br>not know how to describe what I'm feeling right now,<br>I'm completely devastated by the actions of our \"government\". I<br>can do nothing but send out love and support to<br>my Ukrainian brothers. Мои украинские братья, мы с вами, даже<br>если не можем сказать это вслух. Я посылаю вам свою<br>самую искреннюю любовь и поддержку и уверяю вас, что мои<br>соотечественники делают то же самое.Мы один народ, и мы не<br>должны вести какую-то бессмысленную войну только из-за одного сумасшедшего придурка.<br>Нам ничего не остается, кроме как ждать действий Запада и<br>надеяться, что у Путина еще что-то осталось в голове и<br>он лучше знает, чем продолжать эту бестолковую войну.

Thus far,<br>he has been careful to steer around NATO and come<br>up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least<br>placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his<br>policy, but really the only logical one in terms of<br>Putin\\u2019s logical madness. NATO saw this coming, and the U.S.<br>saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that<br>expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any<br>unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin\\u2019s obvious choice. NATO<br>also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the<br>pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much<br>like the fall of the USSR. In the event of<br>this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in<br>Russia awaits. When toppling the regime of a nuclear state,<br>outright war is off the table, but economic war is<br>a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the<br>assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over<br>the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale,<br>and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not<br>historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society<br>is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as<br>history shows. The issue remained, however, that the EU, and<br>NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war<br>on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade<br>a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO,<br>and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin\\u2019s<br>ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined<br>with Europe\\u2019s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to<br>his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future<br>plans. In reality, in played into NATO\\u2019s hand beautifully. The<br>more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When<br>Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their<br>economy would in fact be at the total mercy of<br>the EU. As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with<br>their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of<br>the world watched in real time. Western media made sure<br>that the public knew exactly what was happening up to<br>the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K. and<br>U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally<br>broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much<br>attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised<br>sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents<br>and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped<br>his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to<br>\\u201ccontested\\u201d regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and<br>solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander.

During the timeframe of<br>May 2016 thru to November 2016 Trump and his associates<br>had over 140 direct connections to Russian intelligence & government<br>officials. These contacts went unreported even though, such contacts are<br>required by several laws. Contacts that purposely attempted to hide<br>the contact and the conversations that transpired. Some contacts though<br>weren\\u2019t even a little subtle.

Trump Sr., explicitly pleaded Russia<br>to hack Clinton\\u2019s emails. That should give us an idea<br>of how comfortable Donald Trump was with Russia and bring<br>into question how much contact with Russia he actually had.<br>After that, Donnie Jr. held meetings with Russians where he<br>was directly seeking information from them that could be used<br>against Clinton, even though they were Russian operatives who were<br>working on behalf of the Kremlin. It is established that<br>the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. They hacked into<br>DNC party servers and finding emails that were actually written<br>by Democratic individuals and members of the Clinton campaign. They<br>then released those emails on website (Wikileaks) run Julian Assange<br>just after the meeting with Donald Jr., at a critical<br>time in the campaign to adversely affect Clinton and to<br>bolster Trump. Prior to any American campaigning, Assange was indicted<br>in America on 17 charges relating to the Espionage Act<br>in the United States District Court. Under the Espionage Act<br>charges Assange was facing a sentence of 170 years in<br>prison. Assange was indited for his role in the publication<br>of secret American documents on his website Wikileaks. Republican leaders<br>and the conservative media figures had been demanding prison time<br>(or worse) for Julian Assange for years. Suddenly, with Trump\\u2019s<br>requests and the release of information that negatively impacted his<br>Democratic opponent they were abruptly praising the Australian \\u201canarchist\\u201d. From<br>that request for Russian help, it has been established that<br>LOTS of people in Trump\\u2019s circle had repeated contacts with<br>Russians. These contacts lead to an investigation that resulted in<br>dozens of criminal inditements. Inditements that had five of six<br>of Trump closest advisers pleading guilty.

Don't use the torch unless you absolutely have to.<br>And at least one knife. And a can opener if<br>you take cans. Each bag should have each of these.<br>That way if you get separated you will be ok.<br>Humans can survive a long time without food; we die<br>after three days without water. Take a portable radio and<br>batteries too if you can so you can listen to<br>news even if you are not at home. Don't take<br>any glass bottles, they are heavy and can smash. Take<br>plastic. Buy some candles. If you already have candles, dig<br>them out now. Don;t wait until the lights go out<br>to try to find them. Put them somewhere obvious in<br>the living room and make sure there is a lighter<br>or matches with them. Take menstrual pads if you have<br>them; they can also be used as bandages..also take any<br>medicine anyone needs. Pack it now. Don't leave this till<br>last moment. The medicine goes in the pack of the<br>person who needs it. Might be good to label your<br>packs, or at least make sure everyone knows which pack<br>is theirs. Clean your bathtub now and fill it with<br>water. If the pumping station is attacked / turned off<br>you will not be able to get water from the<br>taps. Get some bandaids too and bandages if you have<br>them. And a pair of scissors. Take a full salt<br>container if you have it. A bottle of water with<br>salt in it is a saline solution and can be<br>used to clean wounds. 4 cups of water to two<br>teaspoons of salt. Make at least one now. Put important<br>papers for each of you inside a resealable plastic bag<br>and put it in your bugout bag. This includes birth<br>cert, ID, Passport, house ownership documents, bank book etc. Put<br>in a blanket each if you have room, and a<br>warm jacket. (thinner is better, you won;t have much room)<br>If you have children, put on small favorite toy in<br>their bag (children get a bag too.) This will help<br>them stay calm and quiet. Even just holding it can<br>help. Take a few packs of cigarettes each if you<br>have them. May be useful for bribes. Bottles of alcohol<br>can also be useful but are heavy. Your bug-out bag<br>should be a backpack for easy carrying and traveling. Get<br>some psychical cash NOW. ATM networks can go down, and<br>your plastic cards will be useless. Also people may stop<br>accepting them. Make sure you each have a decent amount<br>of cash. Put some in your bag, hide the rest<br>on your person in case you are searched. Get dressed,<br>including shoes.Make sure your house keys are already in your<br>pocket. If something happens, grab your bag and GO. Practice<br>doing this, say 1-2-3 go and then everyone must get<br>out the door ASAP. Do this until everyone can do<br>it quickly. Do not take pets with you. Leave them<br>behind. Mobile phones can be tracked, and the Russians probably<br>have some sort of scanner that can detect people hiding<br>by their mobile phones. Turning off the phone will not<br>prevent this. Double or triple wrap your mobile phones in<br>aluminium foil. Then try calling one. If it fails to<br>connect you might be ok. Keep in mind nobody will<br>be able to call you unless you unwrap it. Turn<br>off any scheduled alarms or calendar events or anything else<br>on your phone that may make a noise. If you're<br>hiding somewhere it could get you found and killed. Completely<br>charge all your mobile phones now. Leave them plugged in<br>and charging. When it's go time grab your phones and<br>chargers and put them in the bag, then go. Don't<br>forget to wrap them in layers of foil. You may<br>not be able to access power for a long time.<br>If you can, get a compass and a map. Don't<br>wear camo - you might get mistaken for a soldier.<br>Instead wear unobtrusive clothes. Sneakers may be better than boots<br>as you can move more quietly. It's also easier to<br>travel large distances. However boots may be longer wearing, especially<br>if they are leather. Everyone should be wearing the pair<br>they will need NOW. Or least put them near the<br>door, one pair in front of each person;s bag. A<br>plastic sheet as long as a human body would be<br>good, you can sleep on it even if the ground<br>i wet and wit will provide some warmth- even if<br>it is wet. Two might be good, one for the<br>top as well. Needs to be good strong plastic. You<br>can use your bag as a pillow. Be wary of<br>people you don;t know, even if they appear to be<br>other Ukrainians. They may be desperate and try to rob<br>you. Leave your TV and radio on and listen to<br>the news, 24 hours a day. If the authorities advise<br>getting out, get out. Don;t all sleep at the same<br>time, leave at least one person listening to tv or<br>radio at a time. Also they should keep an eye<br>out the windows. Sometimes news does not travel fast enough.<br>Stay together at home as much as you can from<br>now on. Don't anyone go to visit a neighbour five<br>miles away, unless you are happy to wait for them<br>when the time comes to suddenly leave.

No matter<br>what economic powerhouse Russia may be, no country's economy can<br>survive such devastating attacks. We are losing our income minute<br>by minute, and so are all of our friends who<br>moved abroad to get away from Putin's oppressive regime. The<br>EU is currently debating whether to cut Russia off from<br>SWIFT, and if they deem it necessary, all of our<br>lives are over. The Pig calling itself \\\"Putin\\\" deserves death<br>for what he did to his own nation and it's<br>people. Because of his actions, the world hates us.
